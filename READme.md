# Sardinian barley (S'Orgiu Sardu) project

This repository collects all the commands and script used for the Sardinian barley de novo assembly and pangenome project. This work is part of the PhD project carried out by Lia Obinu.

Some of the scripts used here were developed for the *A. thaliana* reference-free pangenome project and are available at: https://github.com/LiaOb21/arabidopsis_pangenome
